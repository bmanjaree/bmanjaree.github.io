As a part of the wind group, I helped organize modules/lesson plans to teach the high school students in East Jerusalem about basic fluid mechanics, wastewater treatments, climate change, etc., along with building a bicycle-driven pump for the school. I included such activities in the modules to increase the student's inquisitiveness and help them relate fundamental physics and fluid interactions in their surroundings.
