I'm an master's student in the [Civil and Environmental Engineering Department](https://www.ce.washington.edu) at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA. I received my bachelor's degree in  the [Civil and Environmental Engineering Department]([https://www.ce.washington.edu](https://cee.technion.ac.il/en/)) from the Israel Institute of Technology - Technion. My interests include a combination of ocean observations and ocean models to study physical and biogeochemical conditions.
