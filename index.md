I'm a Ph.D. student in the [Civil and Environmental Engineering Department](https://cee.princeton.edu) at Princeton University, NJ. My academic journey includes dual masters degrees from the [Applied Mathematics Department](https://amath.washington.edu) and [Civil and Environmental Engineering Department](https://www.ce.washington.edu) at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA. I completed my bachelor's degree in the [Civil and Environmental Engineering Department](https://cee.technion.ac.il/en/) at the Israel Institute of Technology - Technion. 


Currently, I'm working in Professor [Gabriele Villarini's research group](https://villarini.scholar.princeton.edu/research-group), focusing on advancing data-driven approaches for hydrologic modeling. My research aims to improve predictions and better approximate extreme climate events related to hydrology. 


My work centers on enhancing hydrological modeling through innovative computational and data-driven approaches. My primary research interests include: 


1. Improving hydrological numerical models by applying optimization methods to numerical techniques, enhancing both accuracy and computational efficiency.

2. Leveraging machine learning methods, particularly physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and kernel methods, to develop more robust and adaptable hydrological models.

3. Exploring the coupling of hydrological models with global climate models to better understand and predict the interactions between local water systems and large-scale climate patterns.


Through this research, I aim to contribute to the development of more accurate, efficient, and comprehensive hydrological models that can better inform water resource management and climate adaptation strategies.
